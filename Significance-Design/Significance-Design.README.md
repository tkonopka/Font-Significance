# Font-Significance Design

File Significance-template.sfd is a blank font specification for FontForge.

File Significance-glyphs.svg contains designs for all glyphs. (The preview might not show the glyphs if they are outside the "page")

File Significance-oneglyph.svg is a helper file used when transfering glyphs from Inkscape into FontForge. The workflow:

- Paste a glyph into this file. Remove any helper objects

- Position the glyph relative to the page

- If any objects are "grouped", ungroup them

- Select all objects and convert them to paths (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-Shift-C)

- Set the Stroke to "undefined" (the question mark under "Stoke paint")

- Save the file

- Import in FontForge
